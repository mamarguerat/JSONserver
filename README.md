# JSONserver
Used with *My JSON Server*:
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/mamarguerat/JSONserver

## Beta
For the moment, the project is in beta which means many things may change or break:

* URLs may change
* Service may be down
* Authentication may be added later
* etc...
Use it at your own risk. If you need a reliable solution, please install [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## Limits
To be able to provide a free service to as many people as possible during this phase, the project comes with a few limits:

* Changes are **faked and aren't persisted** (just like JSONPlaceholder)
* Requests are cached (1 minute)
* db.json has limits
* All servers are public
* Private GitHub repositories aren't supported (yet)
